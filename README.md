A little sneak peak 

> **Open Source Weekend for open source noobs** <br>
Let’s be honest, the concept of Open Source Weekend was not our original idea. It was completely inspired from Hacktoberfest by DigitalOcean. In fact, I was super adamant that we must do this in October itself. But it was the middle of October and arranging such events takes time (Specially when we are targeting our audience to just women). November was an exam month in our college, so no, we couldn’t do Hackemberfest. (Please dont comment how hideous that name sounds, we are well aware)
